# Warmups
This is for basic warm ups. 

This currently includes 3 separate warm ups.
1) JS warm ups
2) Holy Grail Layout Warmups
3) Data Structures and Analysis Warm ups

I endeavor to try to do these at least once a week.

All of these warmups originally came from CodeFellows academy. It has been a while since I have been there, and I am creating this repo so I have a clean place to do these practices.

Any practice solutions are pulled from the repository I found still existing of this of a classmate, who retained his repo from codefellows [Billy Bunn](https://github.com/BillyBunn/warm-ups/). He is a fantastic individual.

## Folder Structure
Each warm up will have its own folder for its desciption and the times I have done these

- On each day, create a new branch of this repository with the date
  - e.g., `11-22-2018`
- Create a folder with the same date name
  - e.g., `11-22-2018/`
  - Copy the contents from the folder with the warm up
  - Complete the warm up
